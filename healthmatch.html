  Aim:Healthmatch aims to provide online therapy and free support to people experiencing emotional distress by connecting them with trained volunteers and therapists across the globe.</p>

    <p class="cntr">
     
Idea:
At many places, people donâ€™t feel comfortable to talk about their mental health in front of many people. Our website allows such people to connect to therapists all across the globe with whom they can share their problems and also overcome it.

    </p>

    <p class="cntr">
     How it works: 
It allows users to book an appointment with the therapists according to the date and time they are comfortable with, and pay the fees which books the slot. Therapist then confirms the appointment and schedules a meeting via webcam.

    </p>
    <p class="cntr">
     Motive:
HealthMatch ensures that the anonymity of the users is maintained, so that the users can openly discuss about their health status. Also, our motive is to spread awareness about mental health and help people to open up about their experiences which may help others going through the same.
